# StopWatch
This project is an implementation of a stopwatch on an Atmega16 microcontroller.
# How it work
We will be using timer1 ctc mode to count the seconds and develop a digital clock. There are 3 push buttons which are used to reset, pause or start the stop watch.
Time is displayed live on a 4×7 segment.
# Components
* Atmega16 microcontroller
* Push buttons
* 4×7 segment display
* 7 segment BCD display driver
